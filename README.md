## Personal Portfolio

This project upgrades the [legacy 2022 portfolio page](https://github.com/henriquebf/2022.henriquebf.com) to make benefits of new react/next.js features:

- Server Components
- Parallel Routing
- API Routes / Route Handlers
- New project structure

It also replaces Styles componenents with CSS modules in order to allow server components to be styled.
